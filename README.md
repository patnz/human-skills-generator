# Human Skills Generator
Tired of pretending to be a real human? Let our app do it for you! 

### But seriously...
A big part of Dev Academy Aotearoa is about introspection and growth as individuals and team members.. not just the tech! This app is a cheeky dig at that. Throughout the week, we encounter **real life situations** where we contribute as individuals and this app is designed to **automate those human interactions**. How cool!

## WHAT'S ON TOP GENERATOR
#### (1 x INTERNAL API, 2 x EXTERNAL API)
On a Friday morning the cohort gathers round in a seated circle and answers the question **What's on Top?**...

- Internal API calls a random preamble from a JSON file
  - (I'm pretty tired today...)
- External API calls a Corporate BS Generator API
  - (https://github.com/sameerkumar18/corporate-bs-generator-api)
- External API calls a Random Fact Generator 
  - (https://uselessfacts.jsph.pl)
